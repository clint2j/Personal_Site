        The fence was stained. Not for long. For 40 years, all of Texas A&M has united in service of the surrounding community. Its called big event, and it has long been the largest single-day, single-location service event in the USA. I was proud to continue this tradition last March. I took one look at the long fence mere miles from Kyle field. This was what it was about. Serving those that had served us. The local people had bourn the brunt of the aches and pains of living in a massive college town. This was their day. I took a brush and a bucket of 20% bleach water. I shouldâ€™ve worn a throw-away shirt. But the older gentleman was expecting so much. He had been in my shoes 50 years ago. His aggie ring said 70 or something. His wife was a trailblazer for women in her department. They had both lived a much harder life than me. Their success had made life far more comfortable. I looked back at the fence. This was a task they had put off until it was too late for them to complete. The lawn was beautiful. The fence was stained. Not for long.

            As assistant director of Leadership for MSC Freshmen Leadership International, I am responsible for directing the training of 30+ freshmen in international leadership. Every week, I lead (or assist in leading) a general committee meeting going over international events and themes. In a way, I am serving my university. I help instill an appreciation of international culture in dozens of freshmen so that they can propagate those positive beliefs across the university and the world. We also take a trip every year down to a refugee school in Houston. We deliver nonperishables to help them keep up their stock and we help them renovate parts of the school and organize their stockroom of essentials for those recently arriving refugees. It is important to see the children there, to realize the purpose of all that we do: for with better acceptance and appreciation of international immigrants (especially refugees), they can have a better life.
